<div style="text-align: justify"> I am an avid researcher in field of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. My research interests include Object Detection, 2D/3D Instance Segmentation, Deep Learning model compression, Self-Supervised Learning, AI model evolution and Scene Understanding. I also specialize in compute resource constrained real time inference of Deep Learning based Computer Vision models for various mobile devices like Nvidia AI embedded systems, Apple iphone, drones etc.

I am currently working full time as a ML research engineer at Honeywell. I spend my time researching and building AI based perception system for robotics applications as well as working on personal Computer Vision research projects. </div>
